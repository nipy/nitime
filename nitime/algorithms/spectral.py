    The cross-spectrum between two tapered time-series, derived from a

    Parameters
    ----------

    tx, ty : ndarray (K, ..., N)
       The complex DFTs of the tapered sequence

    weights : ndarray, or 2-tuple or list
       Weights can be specified as a length-2 list of weights for spectra tx
       and ty respectively. Alternatively, if tx is ty and this function is
       computing the spectral density function of a single sequence, the
       weights can be given as an ndarray of weights for the spectrum.
       Weights may be

       * scalars, if the shape of the array is (K, ..., 1)
       * vectors, with the shape of the array being the same as tx or ty

    sides : str in {'onesided', 'twosided'}
       For the symmetric spectra of a real sequence, optionally combine half
       of the frequencies and scale the duplicate frequencies in the range
       (0, F_nyquist).

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : ndarray
       An array of sampled random processes, where the time axis is assumed to

        Sampling rate of the signal

        The normalized half-bandwidth of the data tapers, indicating a
        multiple of the fundamental frequency of the DFT (Fs/N).
        Common choices are n/2, for n >= 4. This parameter is unitless
        and more MATLAB compatible. As an alternative, set the BW
        parameter in Hz. See Notes on bandwidth.

    BW : float
        The sampling-relative bandwidth of the data tapers, in Hz.

    adaptive : {True/False}
       Use an adaptive weighting routine to combine the PSD estimates of
       different tapers.

    jackknife : {True/False}
       Use the jackknife method to make an estimate of the PSD variance
       at each point.

    low_bias : {True/False}
       Rather than use 2NW tapers, only use the tapers that have better than
       90% spectral concentration within the bandwidth (still using
       a maximum of 2NW tapers)

    sides : str (optional)   [ 'default' | 'onesided' | 'twosided' ]
         This determines which sides of the spectrum to return.
         For complex-valued inputs, the default is two-sided, for real-valued
         inputs, default is one-sided Indicates whether to return a one-sided
         or two-sided

    Returns
    -------
    (freqs, psd_est, var_or_nu) : ndarrays
        The first two arrays are the frequency points vector and the
        estimated PSD. The last returned array differs depending on whether
        the jackknife was used. It is either

        * The jackknife estimated variance of the log-psd, OR
        * The degrees of freedom in a chi2 model of how the estimated
          PSD is distributed about the true log-PSD (this is either
          2*floor(2*NW), or calculated from adaptive weights)

    Notes
    -----

    The bandwidth of the windowing function will determine the number
    tapers to use. This parameters represents trade-off between frequency
    resolution (lower main lobe BW for the taper) and variance reduction
    (higher BW and number of averaged estimates). Typically, the number of
    tapers is calculated as 2x the bandwidth-to-fundamental-frequency
    ratio, as these eigenfunctions have the best energy concentration.
