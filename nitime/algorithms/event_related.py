def fir(timeseries, design):
    """
    Calculate the FIR (finite impulse response) HRF, according to [Burock2000]_

    Parameters
    ----------

    timeseries : float array
            timeseries data

    design : int array
          This is a design matrix.  It has to have shape = (number
          of TRS, number of conditions * length of HRF)

          The form of the matrix is:

              A B C ...

          where A is a (number of TRs) x (length of HRF) matrix with a unity
          matrix placed with its top left corner placed in each TR in which
          event of type A occured in the design. B is the equivalent for
          events of type B, etc.

    Returns
    -------

    HRF: float array
        HRF is a numpy array of 1X(length of HRF * number of conditions)
        with the HRFs for the different conditions concatenated. This is an
        estimate of the linear filters between the time-series and the events
        described in design.

    Notes
    -----

    Implements equation 4 in Burock(2000):

        \hat{h} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y

    Calculates the  event related timeseries, using a cross-correlation in the
    frequency domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tseries: float array
       Time series data with time as the last dimension

    events: float array
       An array with time-resolved events, at the same sampling rate as tseries
