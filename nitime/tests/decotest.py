"""Experimental code for cleaner parametric and standalone tests.

- An @as_unittest decorator can be used to tag any normal parameter-less
  function as a unittest TestCase.  Then, both nose and normal unittest will
  recognize it as such.

- A @parametric decorator tags any generator (a function with 'yield') as a
  parametric test.  This generator will get iterated to completion with each
  successful 'yield' counting as a passed test.  If there is a failure, it can
  be debugged with the function's real stack intact, instead of how nose
  approaches this problem (which leaves you inside of the nose stack without
  any access to your original stack).

  Note: this decorator still has one important limitation.  In a parametric
  test, if there is a failure, the whole run for that test stops immediately.
  This is because Python doesn't allow a generator that throws an exception to
  be resumed.  So your total test count will vary, as an early failure means
  that the rest of those sub-tests don't get run.  Each failure has to be fixed
  so the generator can continue.
