""" This module provides lazy import functionality to improve the import
performance of nitime.

A generic LazyImport class is implemented which takes the module name as a
parameter, and acts as a proxy for that module, importing it only when the
module is used, but effectively acting as the module in every other way
(including inside IPython with respect to introspection and tab completion)
with the *exception* of reload() - reloading a LazyImport has no effect.

Commonly used nitime lazy imports are also defined in :mod:`nitime.lazy`, so they can be
reused throughout nitime.

# only for debugging purposes and must be set directly in the source code,

# nitime, importing nitime will import this module.
