"""
Nitime: Time-series analysis for neuroscience

The module has several sub-modules:

- ``timeseries``: contains the constructors for time and time-series objects

- ``algorithms``: Algorithms. This sub-module depends only on scipy,numpy and
  matplotlib. Contains various algorithms.

- ``utils``: Utility functions.

- ``analysis``: Contains *Analyzer* objects, which implement particular
  analysis methods on the time-series objects

- ``viz``: Vizualization

All of the sub-modules will be imported as part of ``__init__``, so that users
have all of these things at their fingertips.

import analysis
