==============================================
Caclulation of Signal to noise and information
==============================================

This method is based on ideas described in [Borst1999]_ (Figure 2) and
[Hsu2004]_. The calculation can be used, for example, in order to estimate the
channel capacity of a neuron responding to a repeated stimulus.

The estimate of the information is based on the formula


.. math::

      I(S,R) = \int_{0}^{Nyquist}log_2(1+SNR(\omega)d\omega


Where $SNR(\omega)$ is the ratio of the signal power and the noise power at the
frequency band centered on $\omega$.This equation holde true for a Gaussian
channel and is an upper bound for all other cases.

The signal power is estimated as the power of the mean response to repeated
presentations of the same signal and the noise power is calculated as the
average of the power in the deviation from this average in each trial

We import the neccesary modules:

"""

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import nitime.utils as utils
import nitime.timeseries as ts
import nitime.viz as viz

"""

For this example, we generate an auto-regressive sequence to be the signal:

"""

ar_seq, nz, alpha = utils.ar_generator(N=128, drop_transients=10)
ar_seq -= ar_seq.mean()

"""

The signal will be repeated several times, adding noise to the signal in each
repetition:

"""

n_trials = 12

fig_snr = []
sample = []
fig_tseries = []

"""

We add different levels of noise to the ar_seq variable, in order to
demonstrate the effects of adding noise on signal to noise ratio, as well as
the calculated information

"""

for idx, noise in enumerate([1, 10, 50, 100]):

    """

    Make n_trials repetitions of the signal:

    """

    sample.append(np.ones((n_trials, ar_seq.shape[-1])) + ar_seq)
    n_points = sample[-1].shape[-1]

    """

    Add noise:

    """

    for trial in  xrange(n_trials):
        sample[-1][trial] += np.random.randn(sample[-1][trial].shape[0]) * noise

    """

    This is the estimate of the signal:

    """

    sample_mean = np.mean(sample[-1], 0)

    """

    We plot a comparison of the actual signal (blue) and this estimate(blue). The
    thinner lines n other colors, represent the individual trials:

    """

    fig_tseries.append(plt.figure())
    ax = fig_tseries[-1].add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
    ax.plot(sample[-1].T)
    ax.plot(ar_seq, 'b', linewidth=4)
    ax.plot(sample_mean, 'r', linewidth=4)
    ax.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax.set_ylabel('Amplitude')

    """

    We present this at different levels of noise. With low noise, the estimate
    of the signal and also the response of the system at different repetitions
    is very similar to the original signal.

    .. image:: fig/snr_example_01.png

    A special visualization function :func:`viz.plot_snr` is used in order to
    display the signal power (blue) and the noise power (green), both in the left
    sub-plot. In addition, the SNR (blue) and the cumulative information (as a
    function of frequency bands, starting from low frequencies, in red) are
    dislplayed in the right subplot.

    """

    tseries = ts.TimeSeries(sample[-1], sampling_rate=1.)
    fig_snr.append(viz.plot_snr(tseries))

"""

.. image:: fig/snr_example_02.png

With more added noise, the estimate of the signal deviates further from the
signal.

.. image:: fig/snr_example_03.png

The signal power remains rather similar, but the noise power increases
(across all bands). As a consequence, the signal to noise ratio decreases and the
accumulated information decreases

.. image:: fig/snr_example_04.png

This becomes even more apparent with more noise:

.. image:: fig/snr_example_05.png


.. image:: fig/snr_example_06.png


Until, with the largest amplitued of noise, the signal power is almost completely
overwhelmed with noise:

.. image:: fig/snr_example_07.png

.. image:: fig/snr_example_08.png

Finally, we use :func:`plot_snr_diff` in order to compare information
transmission (on the left) and the signal to noise ratio (on the right) between
the two last noise levels:
"""

ts1 = ts.TimeSeries(sample[-1], sampling_rate=1.)
ts2 = ts.TimeSeries(sample[-2], sampling_rate=1.)
fig_compare = viz.plot_snr_diff(ts1, ts2)
plt.show()
