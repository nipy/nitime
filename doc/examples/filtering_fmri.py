===================================
Filtering and normalizing fMRI data
===================================

Filtering fMRI data is very important. The time-series usually collected in
fMRI contain a broad-band signal. However, physilogically relevant signals are
thought to be present in only particular parts of the spectrum. For this
reason, filtering operations, such as detrending, are a common pre-processing
step in analysis of fMRI data analysis. In addition, for many fMRI analyses, it
is important to normalize the data in each voxel. This is because data may
differ between different voxels for 'uninteresting' reasons, such as local
blood-flow differences and signal amplitude differences due to the distance
from the receive coil. In the following, we will demonstrate usage of nitimes
analyzer objects for spectral estimation, filtering and normalization on fMRI
data.


We start by importing the needed modules. First modules from the standard lib
and from 3rd parties:

"""

import os

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.mlab import csv2rec


"""

Next, the particular nitime classes we will be using in this example:

"""

import nitime

# Import the time-series objects:
from nitime.timeseries import TimeSeries

# Import the analysis objects:
from nitime.analysis import SpectralAnalyzer, FilterAnalyzer, NormalizationAnalyzer

"""

For starters, let's analyze data that has been preprocessed and is extracted
into indivudal ROIs. This is the same data used in :ref:`multi-taper-coh` and
in :ref:`resting-state` (see these examples for details).

We start by setting the TR and reading the data from the CSV table into which
the data was saved:

"""

TR = 1.89

data_path = os.path.join(nitime.__path__[0], 'data')

data_rec = csv2rec(os.path.join(data_path, 'fmri_timeseries.csv'))

# Extract ROI information from the csv file headers:
roi_names = np.array(data_rec.dtype.names)

# This is the number of samples in each ROI:
n_samples = data_rec.shape[0]

# Make an empty container for the data
data = np.zeros((len(roi_names), n_samples))

# Insert the data from each ROI into a row in the data:
for n_idx, roi in enumerate(roi_names):
    data[n_idx] = data_rec[roi]

# Initialize TimeSeries object:
T = TimeSeries(data, sampling_interval=TR)
T.metadata['roi'] = roi_names


"""

We will start, by examining the spectrum of the original data, before
filtering. We do this by initializing a SpectralAnalyzer for the original data:

"""

S_original = SpectralAnalyzer(T)

# Initialize a figure to put the results into:
fig01 = plt.figure()
ax01 = fig01.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)


"""

The spectral analyzer has several different methods of spectral analysis,
however the all have a common API. This means that for all of them the output
is a tuple. The first item in the tuple are the central frequencies of the
frequency bins in the spectrum and the second item in the tuple are the
magnitude of the spectrum in that frequency bin. For the purpose of this
example, we will only plot the data from the 10th ROI (by indexing into the
spectra). We compare all the methods of spectral estimation by plotting them
together:

"""

ax01.plot(S_original.psd[0],
          S_original.psd[1][9],
          label='Welch PSD')

ax01.plot(S_original.spectrum_fourier[0],
          S_original.spectrum_fourier[1][9],
          label='FFT')

ax01.plot(S_original.periodogram[0],
          S_original.periodogram[1][9],
          label='Periodogram')

ax01.plot(S_original.spectrum_multi_taper[0],
          S_original.spectrum_multi_taper[1][9],
          label='Multi-taper')

ax01.set_xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
ax01.set_ylabel('Power')

ax01.legend()


"""

Notice that, for this data, simply extracting a FFT is hardly informative (the
reasons for that are explained in :ref:`multi-taper-psd`). On the other hand,
the other methods provide different granularity of information, traded-off with
the robustness of the estimation. The cadillac of spectral estimates is the
multi-taper estimation, which provides both robustness and granularity, but
notice that this estimate requires more computation than other estimates
(certainly more estimates than the FFT).

We note that a lot of the power in the fMRI data seems to be concentrated in
frequencies below 0.02 Hz. These extremely low fluctuations in signal are often
considered to be 'noise', rather than reflecting neural processing. In
addition, there is a broad distribution of power up to the Nyquist
frequency. However, some estimates of the hemodynamic response suggest that
information above 0.15 could not reflect the slow filtering of neural response
to the BOLD response measured in fMRI. Thus, it would be advantageous to remove
fluctuations below 0.02 and above 0.15 Hz from the data. Next, we proceed to
filter the data into this range, using different methods.

We start by initializing a FilterAnalyzer. This is initialized with the
time-series containing the data and with the upper and lower bounds of the
range into which we wish to filter (in Hz):

"""

F = FilterAnalyzer(T, ub=0.15, lb=0.02)

# Initialize a figure to display the results:
fig02 = plt.figure()
ax02 = fig02.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)

# Plot the original, unfiltered data:
ax02.plot(F.data[0], label='unfiltered')

"""

As with the SpectralAnalyzer, there is a common API for the different methods
used for filtering. We use the following methods:

- Boxcar filter: The time-series is convolved with a box-car function of the
  right length to smooth the data to such an extent that the frequencies higher
  than represented by the length of this box-car function are no longer present
  in the smoothed version of the time-series. This functions as a low-pass filter. The
  data can then be high-pass filtered by subtracting this version of the data
  from the original. For a band-pass filter, both of these operations are done.

"""

ax02.plot(F.filtered_boxcar.data[0], label='Boxcar filter')

"""

- FIR filter: A digital filter with a finite impulse response. These filters
  have an order of 64 per default, but that can be adjusted by setting the key
  word argument 'filt_order', passed to initialize the FilterAnalyzer. For
  FIR filtering, :mod:`nitime` uses a Hamming window filter, but this can also
  be changed by setting the key word argument 'fir_win'.
  As with the boxcar filter, if band-pass filtering is required, a low-pass
  filter is applied and then a high-pass filter is applied to the resulting
  time-series.

"""

ax02.plot(F.fir.data[0], label='FIR')

"""

- IIR filter: A digital filter with an infinite impulse response function. Per
  default an elliptic filter is used here, but this can be changed, by setting
  the 'iir_type' key word argument used when initializing the FilterAnalyzer.

For both FIR filters and IIR filters, :func:`scipy.signal.filtfilt` is used in
order to achieve zero phase delay filtering.

"""

ax02.plot(F.iir.data[0], label='IIR')

"""

- Fourier filter: this is a quick and dirty filter. The data is FFT-ed into the
  frequency domain. The power in the unwanted frequency bins is removed (by
  replacing the power in these bins with zero) and the data is IFFT-ed back
  into the time-domain.

"""

ax02.plot(F.filtered_fourier.data[0], label='Fourier')
ax02.legend()
ax02.set_xlabel('Time (TR)')
ax02.set_ylabel('Signal amplitude (a.u.)')

"""

Examining the resulting time-series closely reveals that large fluctuations in
very slow frequencies have been removed, but also small fluctuations in high
frequencies have been attenuated through filtering.

Comparing the resulting spectra of these different filters shows the various
trade-offs of each filtering method, including the fidelity with which the
original spectrum is replicated within the pass-band and the amount of
attenuation within the stop-bands.

We can do that by initializng a SpectralAnalyzer for each one of the filtered
time-series resulting from the above operation and plotting their spectra. For
ease of compariso, we only plot the spectra using the multi-taper spectral
estimation. At the level of granularity provided by this method, the diferences
between the methods are emphasized:

"""

S_fourier = SpectralAnalyzer(F.filtered_fourier)
S_boxcar = SpectralAnalyzer(F.filtered_boxcar)
S_fir = SpectralAnalyzer(F.fir)
S_iir = SpectralAnalyzer(F.iir)

"""

Next, we turn to normalize the filtered data. This can be done in one of two
methods:

- Percent change: the data in each voxel is normalized as percent signal
  change, relative to the mean BOLD signal in the voxel

- Z score: The data in each voxel is normalized to have 0 mean and a standard
  deviation of 1.

We will use the filtered data, in order to demonstrate how the output of one
analyzer can be used as the input to the other:

"""

fig04 = plt.figure()
ax04 = fig04.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)

ax04.plot(NormalizationAnalyzer(F.fir).percent_change.data[0], label='% change')

ax04.legend()
ax04.set_xlabel('Time (TR)')
ax04.set_ylabel('Amplitude (% change or Z-score)')

"""

.. image:: fig/filtering_fmri_04.png


Notice that the same methods of filtering and normalization can be applied to
fMRI data, upon reading it from a nifti file, using :mod:`nitime.fmri.io`.

We demonstrate that in what follows.[Notice that nibabel
(http://nipy.org/nibabel) is required in order to run the following
examples. An error will be thrown if nibabel is not installed]

    from nibabel import load

    raise ImportError('You need nibabel (http:/nipy.org/nibabel/) in order to run this example')

We define the TR of the analysis and the frequency band of interest:

"""

TR = 1.35
f_lb = 0.02
f_ub = 0.15
