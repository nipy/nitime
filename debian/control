Description: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data
 Nitime is a Python module for time-series analysis of data from
 neuroscience experiments.  It contains a core of numerical algorithms
 for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a set
 of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects
 that expose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and
 make common analysis tasks easy to express with compact and
 semantically clear code.
