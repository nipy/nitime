 Nitime: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data
===================================================

Nitime contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in
the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent
time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the
numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with compact
and semantically clear code.
